# Microfetch
I woke up today and thought to myself

> you know what I'm going to do today? I'm going get rid of the entire concept of a fetch program and make it fast

so here we are, the entire thing is static, it gets generated by a python script (cause idk how else to do it)
and then gets compiled into an executable

as you can see, it doesnt get any simpler than this

*i recommend [tzyfetch](https://github.com/cappsyco/tzyfetch) if you want an actually useful simple and fast fetch*

## Install
If you want this for some reason, just use the Make command to build it (i spent 1 hour on it(i'm dumb ok? it was my first time doing Makefiles))
```sh
# to build
make
# to clean the files
make clean
```
pretty straight forward if you ask me

## Benchmark stuff
i have no idea how these work or if im doing them correctly (definitely not considering this error that i cant figure out)

>Warning: Statistical outliers were detected. Consider re-running this benchmark on a quiet system without any interferences from other programs. It might help to use the '--warmup' or '--prepare' options.

ignoring that, here's the benchmark showing how fast it is, usefulnes being a cost of speed
```
>hyperfine --warmup 64 -N ./microfetch
Time (mean ± σ):     270.1 µs ±  69.9 µs    [User: 223.7 µs, System: 14.5 µs]
Range (min … max):   203.8 µs … 1463.8 µs    10154 runs
```

PS: I may have used ChatGPT's help for the python script cause I'm stupid, but pfsh who cares if it works it works.
but well hey ChatGPT wasnt doing it right so i still had to edit a lot of the code and figure out some stuff so ig that's better than nothing, right?
PS2: this project was inspired by [tzyfetch](https://github.com/cappsyco/tzyfetch), i also stole almost every asset from them so, sorry?
i didn't know how else to do the logos and color codes, well i checked the licensing, should be *ok*
