I woke up today and thought to myself
> you know what I'm going to do today? I'm going get rid of the entire concept of a fetch program and make it fast
so here we are, the entire thing is static, it gets generated by a python script (cause idk how else to do it)
and then gets compiled into an executable

PS: I may have used ChatGPT's help for the python script cause I'm stupid, but pfsh who cares if it works it works.
but well hey ChatGPT wasnt doing it right so i still had to edit a lot of the code and figure out some stuff so ig that's better than nothing, right?
PS2: this project was inspired by [tzyfetch](https://github.com/cappsyco/tzyfetch), i also stole almost every asset from them so, sorry?
i didn't know how else to do the logos and color codes, well i checked the licensing, should be *ok*
